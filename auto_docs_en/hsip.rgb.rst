Color image synthesis
=====================

Just like hyperspectral images, color images also consist of multiple channels. This functionality allows for the reconstruction of color images from HSI data with colors that closely resemble reality. Additionally, it enables the creation of color images composed of the most informative channels, which can be used for semantic clustering.

Methods for RGB synthesis:

.. automodule:: hsip.rgb.rgb
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

.. automodule:: hsip.rgb.labels
   :members:

Class with a predefined set of colors:
